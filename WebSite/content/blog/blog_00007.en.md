Hello! I'm PanKUN.

Link with Google Drive on Windows and manage large files with rclone.

- Introduction of WinGet
- Installation of rclone
- Google Drive remote settings
- Operation check
I summarized these steps into a single flowchart and visualized it.

# RClone Introduction Flow (Mermaid version)

The final version of the flowchart is [here](https://breadmotion.github.io/WebSite/content/other/Rclone.html).

# What can this flow do?

This flow visualizes the following series of tasks in a Windows environment so that they can be executed without mistakes.

- What to do if WinGet is missing
- Installation of rclone
- Google Drive remote settings
- How to get Drive Folder ID
- Operation check procedure

You can eliminate "stuck points in building a Git LFS substitute environment in Windows" for yourself and your team.

# Overview

This is how to share files so that they can be managed outside the limits of Git LFS in a Windows environment.
The rough flow is as follows.

- Introduction of WinGet
- Introduction of RClone
- RClone settings

Since what follows becomes a story of operation method,
and if aiming at people who are not used to CLI, one more ingenuity is necessary, so I plan to describe it in another article.
