## Self-introduction

Hello, I'm PanKUN.

I am a game engineer working at a game company while also active in indie and personal development.

As I am in my second year as a working professional, I wanted a "place to summarize" my works created in indie or private time to help with future activities, so I created this site.

I considered methods like renting a server or preparing a mini PC for hosting and building the environment from scratch... but I prioritized **"releasing quickly"** first, so I am using GitHub Pages this time.

The quality of the page depends on me, so I plan to brush it up while researching various things in the future.
I hope to grow through this site, including that process.

## What I want to do

The major goals of this site are as follows:

- To grow the portfolio into something "commercial-level" in the future
- To aim for a state where work requests and project consultations come starting from the portfolio

The aims of creating a technical blog are:

- Detailed feature introduction of created projects
- Explanation of tools and mechanisms made personally

I want to summarize such content and use it as **supplementary material for the portfolio**.

The blog articles themselves will become **part of the portfolio showing skills and achievements** in the long run, so I started it feeling "this is a good deal".

## Site Structure Image

The configuration currently envisioned is like this.

**Portfolio**
: A place to summarize progress reports, publication of works, and related blog articles.

**Blog**
: Technical notes, introduction of some features of works under development, organizing stumbling blocks, etc.

**Project List**
: List and brief description of projects participated/created, announcements if necessary.

**Service List**
: A page summarizing what the author can provide and what can be consulted (organizing how I can help).

**Skill List**
: A skill sheet-like page organizing technologies I can touch and areas I am good at.

**Contact**
: A page summarizing access information to the author, such as activity locations and contact information.

## Finally

Thank you for reading to the end!

Although it is a site just launched, I intend to continue updating technical articles and introductions of productions.

I would be very happy if you could peek in occasionally.
Thank you for your continued support.
