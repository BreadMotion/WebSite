Hello! This is Pan-kun.

This time, I've summarized **Text Thread** and **slash commands** related to the AI features of the Zed editor.

![Zed's Text Thread and Slash Commands](../assets/img/blog_00017_0.png)

## What is Text Thread?

Zed's Assistant Panel (AI chat screen) is not just a chat UI, but is actually treated as an **editor buffer**.
In other words, you can do the following just like with a normal text file:

- Use cursor operations and shortcut keys as they are
- Open multiple AI chats as tabs
- Save the contents of the conversation as a text file

By utilizing this, it becomes possible to save past technical consultations as `.md` files and manage them as a knowledge base.

## Accelerate Routine Processing with Slash Commands (`/`)

While the `@` introduced last time was a function to specify the context (reference files, etc.),
**slash commands (`/`)** are a function to **call specific instructions (prompts) to the AI**.

For example, you can register frequently used instructions such as "Refactor this code," "Translate to Japanese," and "Write unit tests" as commands starting with `/`.

### Basic Usage

When you enter `/` in the input field of the Assistant Panel, a list of registered commands is displayed.
Simply select one and press Enter to expand the pre-configured prompt.

The part that you used to type in manually, such as "Please explain about ~", can now be done with just `/explain`.

### Creating Your Own Slash Commands

A powerful feature of Zed is that you can define these slash commands yourself.
You can add them by writing in the configuration file (`settings.json`) as follows:

```json
{
  "assistant": {
    "slash_commands": {
      "refactor": {
        "description": "Refactor the code",
        "text": "Please refactor the selected code to be more readable and efficient. Please also explain the changes and the reasons for them."
      },
      "doc": {
        "description": "Generate documentation",
        "text": "Generate documentation comments in JSDoc format (or a format appropriate for the language) for the selected code."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By setting it up like this, you can instantly call up a well-thought-out, high-precision prompt simply by typing `/refactor`.

## How to Use `@` and `/`

- **`@` (Context)**: "What" to talk about (file, symbol, document, etc.)
- **`/` (Command)**: "What" to make it do (explain, modify, generate tests, etc.)

By combining these two, it is possible to **instruct the AI by describing the "target" and "operation" like a command line**, such as:
`@main.rs /refactor`
This is the key to accelerating the AI experience in Zed.

## Summary

By combining history management with Text Thread and calling up routine prompts with slash commands, Zed becomes more than just an editor; it becomes your "own personal development partner."
In particular, slash commands are fun to develop your own favorite prompts, so be sure to play around with the configuration file.

Have a comfortable Zed life!
