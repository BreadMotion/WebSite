Hello! This is Pan-kun.

This time, I tried out a tool that I happened to see on X (formerly Twitter).  
It's called [Discordo](https://github.com/ayn2op/discordo?tab=readme-ov-file)!

After checking the README.md, the installation seemed very easy, so I'll describe how to install it on a Windows environment.

### Installation Method

1.  **Download**:  
    Download Discordo for Windows from [here](https://nightly.link/ayn2op/discordo/workflows/ci/main) and extract the zip file.
    
2.  **Placement**:  
    Place the `discordo.exe` file in the extracted folder into an arbitrary directory.  
    Example: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Discordo`
    
3.  **Environment Variable**:  
    Add the path of the directory where you placed `discordo.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable.  
    This allows you to execute the `discordo` command from the command prompt or Git Bash.
    
4.  **Execution**:  
    Start the command prompt or Git Bash and type `discordo` to execute it.  
    The first time you start it, a screen will appear asking you to select a login method.  
    Log in using a QR code or your email address and password.

Now, let's take a look at the basic usage after logging in.

### Basic Usage

After logging in, a list of Discord channels will be displayed on the terminal.

*   **Channel Selection**:
    *   Use the up/down keys to select a channel.
    *   Press the Enter key to enter the selected channel.
*   **Message Sending**:
    *   Enter a message in the channel and press the Enter key to send it.
*   **Commands**:
    *   You can execute commands starting with `/`.
    *   Example: `/help` to display help
*   **Exit**:
    *   Exit Discordo with `Ctrl + C`.

### Useful Features

Discordo has several useful features for operating Discord from the terminal.

*   **Mentions**:
    *   You can send mentions with `@username`. You can complete the username with the Tab key.
*   **File Sending**:
    *   Not implemented yet. (Unfortunately)
*   **Emoji**:
    *   You can send emojis with `:emoji_name:`. You can complete the emoji name with the Tab key.
*   **Markdown**:
    *   You can decorate messages in Markdown format, just like in Discord.
    *   Example: `*emphasis*`, `**bold**`, `_italics_`

### Application Examples

By using Discordo, you can consider various applications for operating Discord from the terminal.

*   **Scripts**:
    *   By executing Discordo from a script, you can automate the sending of routine messages and the control of bots.
*   **Server Monitoring**:
    *   You can create a script that monitors the status of the server and notifies Discord if an abnormality occurs.

### Precautions

Here are some precautions when using Discordo.

*   **Security**:
    *   This tool is an unofficial client. Since you will be entering your Discord login information (email address and password), please use it at your own risk.
    *   Use it only in a trusted environment and be careful about security, such as avoiding reusing passwords.
*   **Terms of Service**:
    *   The use of unofficial clients may violate Discord's Terms of Service. Please understand that there is a risk that your account may be affected before using it.

### Summary

Discordo is a convenient tool that allows you to easily operate Discord from the terminal.  
For engineers, it can lead to improved work efficiency because they can check Discord information and send messages without leaving the terminal.
